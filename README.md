## My RSpec Playground

This repo will document my first experiences with RSpec. You can find completed examples below:

1. Greeter - My first test driven program. Example taken from the RSpec pill from Makers Academy PreCourse material.

2. FizzBuzz - Another Makers Academy PreCourse exercise. This time paired with [@TomJamesDuffy](https://github.com/TomJamesDuffy) to complete the exercise. [Link to repo](https://github.com/Hemesh-Unka/fizzbuzz)
